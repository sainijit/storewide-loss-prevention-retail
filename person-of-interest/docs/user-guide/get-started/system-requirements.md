# System Requirements

This page provides detailed hardware, software, and platform requirements to help you set up
and run the POI Re-identification system efficiently.

## Hardware Requirements

| Component     | Minimum                         | Recommended                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CPU           | Intel® Core™ i7 (8th gen+)     | Intel® Xeon® Scalable (4th gen+)    |
| RAM           | 16 GB                           | 32 GB                                |
| Storage       | 50 GB SSD                       | 100 GB NVMe SSD                      |
| GPU           | Not required (CPU inference)    | Intel® Arc™ for accelerated inference |
| Network       | 1 Gbps Ethernet                 | 10 Gbps Ethernet                     |

## Software Requirements

| Software      | Version         | Purpose                              |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Ubuntu        | 22.04 / 24.04   | Host operating system                |
| Docker        | 24.0+           | Container runtime                    |
| Docker Compose| v2.20+          | Multi-container orchestration        |
| Python        | 3.10+           | Backend runtime                      |
| Git           | 2.30+           | Version control                      |
| Make          | 4.3+            | Build automation                     |

## Supported Platforms

The POI system has been validated on:

- Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors (4th and 5th Generation)
- Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and 24.04 LTS

## Intel® SceneScape Requirements

The POI system requires Intel® SceneScape with the following DLStreamer models:

| Model                                  | Purpose               | Output              |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `person-detection-retail-0013`         | Person detection      | Bounding boxes       |
| `face-detection-retail-0004`           | Face detection        | Face bounding boxes  |
| `face-reidentification-retail-0095`    | Face re-identification | 256-d float32 vector |
| `person-reidentification-retail-0277`  | Body re-identification | 256-d float32 vector |

> **Note:** The POI system uses only face embeddings (`face-reidentification-retail-0095`) for
> FAISS matching. Body re-identification embeddings (`person-reidentification-retail-0277`)
> are from a different embedding space and are used only for SceneScape cross-camera tracking.

## Compatibility Notes

- GPU inference acceleration requires Intel® integrated graphics or compatible Intel®
  discrete GPUs with OpenVINO™ support.
- FAISS is configured with `IndexFlatIP` for exact cosine similarity — no GPU acceleration
  is required for the vector search component.
- Redis 8.x is recommended for optimal performance with the event storage and caching layer.

## Validation

- Follow instructions at [Get Started](../get-started.md) to verify the deployment.
