# Build from Source

This guide provides detailed instructions for building the POI Re-identification application
container images from source code. Whether you are customizing the application or
troubleshooting deployment issues, this guide walks you through the complete build process.

## Overview

The POI Re-identification application consists of multiple components that work together:

- **POI Backend**: FastAPI server for POI enrollment, FAISS matching, MQTT consumption, and
  alert generation.
- **React UI**: TypeScript/React single-page application for the operator interface.
- **Alert Service**: Dedicated alert fan-out microservice (pre-built image).
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for metadata, events, and caching.
- **MCP Server**: FastMCP server exposing AI tools for LLM/VLM integration.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sainijit/storewide-loss-prevention-retail.git
cd storewide-loss-prevention-retail/person-of-interest
```

## Step 2: Initialize Environment

```bash
make init-env
```

Edit the generated `.env` file with your SceneScape connection details. See
[Get Started](../get-started.md#step-2-initialize-environment) for required variables.

## Step 3: Build the Docker Images

### Local Build (No Registry)

```bash
make build REGISTRY=false
```

This builds the following images locally:

| Image                              | Dockerfile               | Description          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `person-of-interest-poi-backend`   | `backend/Dockerfile`     | Backend API server   |
| `person-of-interest-ui`            | `ui/Dockerfile`          | React UI             |

> **Note:** The MCP server image (`person-of-interest-mcp-server`) is not built by default.
> To build it, run `docker compose build mcp-server` separately.

### Registry Build

To build and tag images for a container registry:

```bash
export REGISTRY=docker.io/username
make build
```

This builds the images and tags them as:

- `docker.io/username/poi-backend:latest`
- `docker.io/username/poi-ui:latest`

### What the Build Does

The `make build` target performs the following:

1. **Pulls SceneScape images** (if available) from the local Docker cache
2. **Builds POI backend** — multi-stage Docker build with OpenVINO™ runtime, FAISS, and
   Python dependencies
3. **Builds POI UI** — multi-stage Node.js build producing a static nginx container
4. **Tags images** for the specified registry (if `REGISTRY` is not `false`)

## Step 4: Launch the Application

```bash
make up
```

Verify all containers are running:

```bash
make status
```
